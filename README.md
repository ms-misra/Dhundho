# Dhundho
Web development application using JAVA and MySQL.


The team implemented this project based on the concept of finding missing people and built a platform which is easy to use and is effective for the community to report their missing loved ones , keep track of updates and happenings with regards to their posted reports and flag any fake/false reports they come across which were posted by other people. 

There are two types of users for our application , a normal user can post reports , flag other reports as fake and give updates on any report for which they may have information about. The admin can discard false flags if they come to the conclusion that the report is legitimate or can delete the report if it turns out to be false and take required actions on the users.
